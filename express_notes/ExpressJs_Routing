web framework expressjs provede resources such as html, pages, scripts, images etc. at dirrenrent routes

routers 
Defining routes like above is very tedious to maintain. To separate the routes from our main index.js file, we will use Express.Router. Create a new file called things.js and type the following in it.

functions used to define routes in an Express app- 
    - app.<method_name>(path, handler)
        - this method can be applied to any http verbs - get, set, put delete, 
    - An alternate method also exists for independent of the request type.
    - in app.method(path, handler) , path is hte route where the request will run and handeler is callback function that execute relevant route,

We can also have multiple different methods at the same route. Example show in below image in file multi_methods.js

To test this request, open up your terminal and use cURL to execute the following request âˆ’
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/hello"
