building url
- We have studied static routers up until now
- we can also create dynamic routes in expressjs for that we SHOULD provide different types of routes
-dynalic routes allows us to pass parameter and process based on then 
-You can use the req.params object to access all the parameters you pass in the url. 



pattern matched routes
- can also use regex to restrict URL parameter matching
-Let us assume you need the id to be a 5-digit long number

e.g
        app.get('/things/:id([0-9]{5})', function(req, res){
            res.send('id: ' + req.params.id);
        });

Note that this will only match the requests that have a 5-digit long id.
 If none of your routes match the request, you'll get a "Cannot GET <your-request-route>" message as response.
